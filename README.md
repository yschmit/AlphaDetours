# Algorithms presented in my Bachelor thesis

In my thesis I presented 3 algorithms about analysing alpha-detours of maximum matchings.
The algorithm named LinearProgram defines the constraints of a linear program proving the bounds for alpha-detours in general metric spaces.
The folder Graph-Induced contains an alogorithm analysing the bounds of graph-induced metric spaces given a complete list of graphs. It further contains the complete list of graphs of 6 and 8 nodes.
The algorithm GridSearch approximates the best detours of maximum matchings in the Euclidean space.
